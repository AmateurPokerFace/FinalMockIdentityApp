## Introduction
This application is intended to help the Cross Country team keep track of their run data. The app allows the team to record the attendance of runners at practices, record the runners' distance and run time for each practice, view run data for past practices, make and respond to announcements, and calculate run paces based on distance and run time. Users of the application fall into five categories: Master Admin, Coach, Runner, Waiting for approval, and Banned user. 
- The Master Admin user(s) have full access priviledges to all areas of the app. 
- The Coach users have access to most areas of the app, excluding the Master Admin panel.
- The Runner users have limited access to only the pages associated with their own data, and limited access to the forum.
- The Waiting For Approval and Banned users cannot access the application.
